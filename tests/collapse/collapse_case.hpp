/** Collapse evidence harness (issue #9): shared contract for every case variant
 *
 * A case is one application scenario implemented several ways (variants): `handwritten.cpp` is the
 * equal-work reference without Sub0Pub; the other files implement the same behaviour through a Sub0Pub
 * coding pattern. Every variant defines the same three entry points, which tests/collapse/driver.cpp calls:
 *
 *   collapse_setup()          construct the application objects (construction cost is measured)
 *   collapse_publish(v)       the application's publication call site (the publication path under test)
 *   collapse_teardown()       destroy them (destruction cost is measured)
 *
 * Entry points are extern "C" and not inlined into the driver: they are the boundary of the application code
 * being measured. Everything *inside* them may be inlined and optimised freely.
 *
 * Each case is built in two forms (COLLAPSE_OBSERVABLE):
 *   1 observable-work: receivers change observable state; the result (checksum) must match handwritten
 *   0 removable-work:  receivers do no observable work; ideal code removes the machinery around them
 * Argument side effects (collapse::arg) are observable in both forms and must always be preserved.
