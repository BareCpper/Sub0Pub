/** A primary handler claims commands — ordered fallback delivery
 *
 * Use when: an earlier receiver can handle a message and prevent later receivers from handling it.
 * Demonstrates: ThreadLocalContext enabling cancel(), and cancellation scoped to one publication.
 * Story: PrimaryHandler subscribes before FallbackHandler. It claims commands below 100 and
 * cancels further delivery. Command 200 reaches the fallback; commands 42 and 7 do not.
 * Keep in mind: receiver order is part of this pattern. cancel() does not disconnect a receiver
 * or cancel the next publication. Unlike filter(), it stops later receivers for this publication.
 * Run: Sub0Pub_Cancellation prints primary handling of 42/7 and fallback handling of 200.
