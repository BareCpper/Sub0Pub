/** Publisher, accumulators and stream adapters for the cross-DLL experiment
 *
 * Use when: tracing the participants introduced by main.cpp.
 * Demonstrates: publishers/subscribers for float and int plus their serialization adapters.
 * Story: ReadingSource emits 1.019F and 2 per call. ReadingAccumulator adds both to total;
 * ReadingStreamForwarder writes serialized bytes to stdout via its inherited serializer.
 * ReadingStreamReceiver is an unused stdin deserialization sketch, not instantiated by main.cpp.
 * Keep in mind: the shared total and broker state are part of the unvalidated module-sharing
 * experiment. Mixed diagnostic/binary stdout is illustrative, not a production transport protocol.
 * Run: companion header for the disabled Sub0Pub_CrossModule targets; see main.cpp and README.md.
