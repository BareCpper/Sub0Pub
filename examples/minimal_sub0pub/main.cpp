/** An increment source updates a running total — the smallest runtime pattern
 *
 * Use when: you want a compact starting point for one publisher and one subscriber.
 * Demonstrates: Publish<uint32_t>, Subscribe<uint32_t>, and a noexcept receive() callback.
 * Story: RunningTotal subscribes when constructed. IncrementSource publishes 3141 once,
 * and RunningTotal adds that value to its own total. Scope exit disconnects the subscriber.
 * Keep in mind: this is the default unlocked runtime broker, not static wiring. Registration
 * must succeed before delivery is expected; the sample checks that its one receiver subscribed.
 * Run: Sub0Pub_MinimalExample returns zero when the total is 3141; it prints nothing.
