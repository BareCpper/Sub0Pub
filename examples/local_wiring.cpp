/** A thermometer and fault log — wiring known local receivers
 *
 * Use when: receivers are known at composition time but live as ordinary local objects.
 * Demonstrates: wire(), the Publisher mixin, handles_v and type-matched receive() overloads.
 * Story: a thermometer sends a reading to a display. The same wiring sends a sensor fault
 * to the fault log; receivers without a matching receive() are skipped.
 * Keep in mind: wiring borrows its receivers, which must outlive it and the publisher.
 * No runtime subscription table is involved.
 * Run: Sub0Pub_Example_local_wiring returns zero when the checks pass.
