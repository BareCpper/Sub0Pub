/** One-shot diagnostics leave a cooling controller running
 *
 * Use when: runtime observers behind fixed wiring need broker policy and session ownership.
 * Demonstrates: BrokerPort, Scoped Domain, Snapshot and callback disconnect().
 * Story: two one-shot probes disconnect after their first reading. The fixed cooling
 * controller keeps receiving; closing the diagnostic session also leaves that fixed path intact.
 * Keep in mind: Snapshot permits callback self-removal. The Domain must outlive its bound
 * handles. This unlocked example is not safe for concurrent access; a plain DynamicPort
 * does not provide these lifetime guarantees.
 * Run: Sub0Pub_Example_scoped_diagnostics returns zero when the checks pass.
