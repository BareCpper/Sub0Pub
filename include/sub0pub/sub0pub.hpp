/** Sub0Pub: the umbrella header. Includes every part of the library; `#include <sub0pub/sub0pub.hpp>` is all most
 *  applications need. A translation unit that uses only one part may include that part's entry header instead:
 *
 *   sub0pub/config_macros.hpp  SUB0PUB_* configuration macros: every default, defined once
 *   sub0pub/types.hpp          general-purpose helper types
 *   sub0pub/utility/           hashing and type identity, layout fingerprinting, streams, detection traits
 *   sub0pub/config.hpp         per-Data policy (capacity, dispatch, context, lock, filter, storage) and its resolution
 *   sub0pub/broker.hpp         the runtime broker: Subscribe, Publish, SubscribeAll, Domain, Route, publish(), cancel()
 *   sub0pub/wiring.hpp         static wiring: wire(), StaticWiring, Sink, Publisher, Forward, DynamicPort
 *   sub0pub/wiring/broker_port.hpp   BrokerPort: static wiring to the runtime broker
 *   sub0pub/ipc.hpp            IPC serialisation: StreamSerializer, StreamDeserializer, DefaultSerialisation
 *   sub0pub/ipc/forward.hpp    ForwardSubscribe/ForwardPublish: the runtime broker to IPC
 *
 *  Each area directory (utility/, broker/, wiring/, ipc/) holds one header per responsibility. SUB0PUB_* macros are
 *  read when sub0pub/config_macros.hpp is first included, so define them before the first Sub0Pub include (or on
 *  the compiler command line) whichever header that is.
